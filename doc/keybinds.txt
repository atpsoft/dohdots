movement keys should extend selection when a selection block is active

****** ctrl-g behavior
if multi selection is active, switch to single selection
if single selection is active, turn it off
hide/cancel auto complete
hiding overlays/panels

****** other
cmd+shift+g: find all instances of cursor text and multi select them (in sublime)
- in vscode: clear search results?
cmd+shift+l: turn current single selection into multi selection by line

ctrl+x,ctrl+s: save current file (or save all?)
ctrl+j,ctrl+i: reindent/reformat
cmd+0,#,<something>: repeat <something>
ctrl+j,ctrl+j: jumpy word mode
ctrl+j,ctrl+x: jumpy exit (seems like should be able to just use ctrl+g for this)

****** switching files
ctrl+x,b or ctrl+x,ctrl+b or cmd+b: switch to already open file

****** pane/buffer/file layout management
ctrl+x,0: remove current pane from layout
ctrl+x,1: single pane layout
ctrl+x,2: horizontal double pane layout
ctrl+x,3: vertical double pane layout
ctrl+x,o: switch to other pane
cmd+i: switch to terminal (vscode only)
cmd+1 to cmd+8: switch to file/buffer tab by number
cmd+k,1: move editor to first group (not sure if this will stay)

****** searching
ctrl+j,ctrl+l: goto line in current file
ctrl+j,ctrl+f: goto function/symbol in current file
ctrl+s: enter incremental forward search mode and find next when in that mode already
ctrl+r: same as ctrl+s but searching backward
ctrl+j,ctrl+r: search & replace with confirmation interactively
- then cmd+enter to replace all
k: find next - in search buffer
j: find prev - in search buffer

****** sql
ctrl+j,ctrl+m,ctrl+m: read-only query
ctrl+j,ctrl+m,ctrl+x: write-only query
ctrl+j,ctrl+m,ctrl+l: read or write query; local connection
ctrl+j,ctrl+m,ctrl+p: change profile
ctrl+j,ctrl+m,ctrl+f: change path (sqlite)
